# Tech Projects Portfolio

> A collection of projects demonstrating my skills in software development as a university student aspiring to become a software engineer.

##  Overview
This repository contains multiple projects covering **backend, frontend, and full-stack development**. Each project showcases different technologies and programming concepts that Iâ€™ve learned and implemented.

The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate my ability to:
- Build functional web applications
- Structure backend APIs
- Work with databases
- Create interactive frontends
- Solve real-world problems through code
